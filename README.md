# [Day-Progress](https://github.com/Somnia1337/Day-Progress) v0.3.0

A simple reimplementation of [Day-Progress](https://sindresorhus.com/day-progress) by Sindre Sorhus (originally for macOS), showing the percentage of time remaining in the day (excluding sleep hours).

This is a tray application, meaning:

- It does not have a main window or command-line interface (CLI).
- Configuration (mainly your wake and sleep times) must be set before compiling, so you'll need to build it from source.
